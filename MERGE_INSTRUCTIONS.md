# 🔄 How to Merge to Main Branch

Since direct pushes to `main` require special permissions, you'll need to create a Pull Request on GitHub to merge the new documentation files.

## 📋 What Will Be Merged

These 3 files will be added to main:
- ✅ **COMPLETE_PROJECT_GUIDE.md** - 5,587 lines (160 KB) - Complete tutorial
- ✅ **GITHUB_STATUS.md** - 521 lines - Repository status
- ✅ **REPOSITORY_COMPLETE_INVENTORY.md** - 236 lines - Branch comparison

**Total:** 6,344 lines of comprehensive documentation!
